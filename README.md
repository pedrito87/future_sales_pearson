# future_sales_pearson

Future sales prediction problem. This is quite a unique project, as the data we are provided with requires a lot of work, and leaves a lot to the Data Scientist's imagination.
This notebook shows how to deal with big datasets in pandas in a couple of lines of code, and finding sense in the data, through visualising data in matplotlib.
The most special part of the project lays in the model creation part. I create an advanced entity embeddings based, neural network with multiple inputs model, especially tailores for the problem at hand.
